# AppInstallerForWin8

A Windows Store App Installer for Windows 8.x.

(Translated by ChatGTP)

The purpose of this project is actually to create an intuitive and visually appealing Windows Store app installer, which also serves a personal need. Unfortunately, I only have a foundation in C/C++ programming, and I am not familiar with .NET/WinRT/HTML/JavaScript/Win32API. Here, I would like to thank AI (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and DeepSeek) for making this project possible when it seemed impossible. That being said, suitable tools were actually hard to find (back in the Windows 8.x era). I remember Windows App Boss, but it wasn’t specialized—it also had other features. Over such a long period, there weren’t that many tools available, and compared to today, they were difficult to find, which is quite regretful.

The functionality of this tool is actually very simple: it’s just about "installing" a task. However, it also provides some additional information. Though it might not be as thorough as Microsoft’s official installer, it works well for Windows 8.x and for installing apps that the earlier versions of Microsoft’s App Installer could not. As for installing Microsoft’s official installer, it’s recommended to continue using it.

The code itself is not particularly instructive; it’s either because AI or my programming is a bit chaotic, but feel free to use it, offer suggestions, or add to it. The reason I chose WebUI is that UI design is too difficult—after all, websites can use animations and other conveniences. The WebUI uses the IE browser control, but it seems Windows 8 couldn’t use IE 10, so I had to create a compatible webpage, which isn’t very pretty, but there’s no choice.

This project is for learning and research purposes only.
